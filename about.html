            <p>Just a girl who likes to spend much of her time on catching up on her thriller novels and creating magic on the web. </p>
            <p>.</p>
            <p>I've always had an eye for design and creating something beautiful--eye catching to the public eye. So, when I discovered that I could actually create it at the comfort of my own home as long as I have a computer in my hands, I knew that I had finally found something I enjoyed and that will help me avoid people!</p>

            <p>These are some of the projects I've done since I started my Software Engineering course here at Moringa. It has been a challenge but I appreciate the needed practice to become a better developer.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The left and right photos are a Html Travel blog project that I did as a bonus to attempt using CSS by adding padding, a background color and images. The middle is an album cover that I was told to create for Pharell Williams to promote his song, 'HAPPY' from the animation, 'DESPICABLE ME 2'.</p>
